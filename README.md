# Store-to-Door
Description: 
My final project for the Iron Yard is called Store to Door and is a grocery store order and delivery service. I used MVC 
architecture for the front-end user experience (Backbone, React). User data including user auth, information, ordered items were
saved to a back-end Django/Python server. Grocery item data was obtained through restful API requests to Supermarket API.
I created this project in coordination with a back-end engineer (ConnorFieldUser) who created a driver side view that 
enables an interested individual to sign up to become a driver, log in, view and accept pending orders. Our site is hosted
on heroku.

Tech: HTML/CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Backbone, React, Restful API (JSON), Django/Python, heroku
